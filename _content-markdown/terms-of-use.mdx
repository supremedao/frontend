## Terms of use

### Introduction
This disclaimer ("Disclaimer") applies to your use of the products and automated DeFi strategies provided by SupremeDAO ("we," "us," "our"). By participating in SupremeDAO's products and strategies, you ("User," "you," "your") acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to this Disclaimer.
No Financial Advice
The information provided by SupremeDAO, including but not limited to our white paper, website, and any other materials, is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial, investment, legal, or any other form of professional advice. You should not interpret any information or other material provided by SupremeDAO as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice. You are solely responsible for conducting your own due diligence and consulting with your financial, legal, tax, and other professional advisors before making any investment decision.

### Investment Risks
Investing in decentralized finance (DeFi) and utilizing SupremeDAO's automated DeFi strategies involves significant risks. These risks include, but are not limited to, market volatility, liquidity risks, smart contract risks, and potential loss of capital. By participating in SupremeDAO's products and strategies, you acknowledge and agree that you are fully aware of these risks and accept full responsibility for any loss or damage that may occur.

### APYs Being Indicative
All APYs listed on this site are for guidance purposes only. SupremeDAO employs strategies across a broad range of markets. The available liquidity in said markets changes constantly. As a result, SupremeDAO cannot calculate APYs in real time. Users acknowledge this and also acknowledge the risk of negative returns on their deposited funds during certain time periods. By depositing funds in SupremeDAO's vaults, the user assumes any associated risk of loss.

### Risk of Loss of Funds When Using Our Products
Our products are a smart contract-based suite of technologies that relies on blockchain technology. By depositing your funds into our vaults, you recognize and assume all risks inherent in such technologies, including but not limited to the risk that the smart contracts underlying our vaults could fail, resulting in a total loss of user funds. SupremeDAO is not responsible for any such losses.

### UI Usage and Legal Jurisdictions
Our interface is NOT offered to persons or entities who reside in, are citizens of, are incorporated in, or have a registered office in the United States of America or any prohibited localities. SupremeDAO is a decentralized finance project and does not hold any securities licenses in the U.S. or any other jurisdiction. Any investment made through our protocol shall be made with this in mind.
Furthermore, by accepting these terms, you acknowledge and warrant that you are not a citizen of or otherwise accessing the website from the following nations or geographical locations: Democratic Republic of Congo, Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), China, Cuba, Hong Kong, India, Iraq, Iran, Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea), Libya, Mali, Myanmar (Burma), Nicaragua, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Zimbabwe, and/or any other jurisdiction prohibited by the United States Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC).

### Smart Contract & Security Risks
While SupremeDAO implements security measures to protect the assets and data involved in our products, no system is entirely secure. SupremeDAO's products operate through the use of smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts are experimental and may be subject to coding errors, bugs, hacking, and other unforeseen vulnerabilities. SupremeDAO disclaims any liability for losses or damages resulting from the use or malfunction of smart contracts, including but not limited to security breaches, coding errors, or vulnerabilities exploited by third parties.

### Regulatory Risks
The regulatory environment for DeFi is evolving, and regulatory developments could adversely affect SupremeDAO's products and your investment. SupremeDAO does not guarantee that its products comply with all current and future regulations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your participation in SupremeDAO's products is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.

### Assumption of Risk
You assume the risks of engaging in transactions that rely on smart contracts and other experimental technology. Transactions involving SupremeDAO's products rely on smart contracts stored on various blockchains, cryptographic tokens generated by the smart contracts, and other nascent software, applications, and systems that interact with blockchain-based networks. These technologies are experimental, speculative, inherently risky, and subject to change. Among other risks, bugs, malfunctions, cyberattacks, or changes to the applicable blockchain (e.g., forks) could disrupt these technologies and even result in a total loss of cryptoassets, their market value, or digital funds. You are solely responsible for the safekeeping of the private key associated with the blockchain address used to interact with SupremeDAO's products. SupremeDAO assumes no liability or responsibility for any such risks. If you are not comfortable assuming these risks, you should not access or engage in transactions using blockchain-based technology.

### Transactions on the Blockchain
Transactions recorded on the blockchain, including transfers of cryptoassets and data programmed into these assets (such as revenue and interest allocations), must be treated as permanent and cannot be undone by SupremeDAO or by anyone. You must be very careful when you finalize any transaction that will be recorded on the blockchain.
