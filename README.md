This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
Install PNPM package manager https://pnpm.io/

To start the development server:

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Markdown pages
Dynamic pages like `/about`, `/privacy`, `/terms`, etc. are generated with a help of Markdown files. 

You can find them at the `/_content-markdown` folder. 


## CI/CD
Currently we use Netlify for CI/CD. 

## Release management

`main` - production branch

`develop` - opening a PR triggers a deployment. The link can be found in the Pull Request itself.
